## UX: User Experience

### User Stories

As a user,

- I would like to feel engaged with the website through the use of images and colours.
- I would like to be able to navigate easily through the website.
- I would like to be left feeling that I want to sign up to learn more.
- I would like to be inspired to invest in my wellbeing.
- I would like to be able to leave my details and be assured someone will be in contact.

### Initial Concept

The inital concept was to create a website that was visually engaging rather than a website that was full of information. Therefore the website has a colour theme throughout and is engaging from the Home page which offers a picture in the header and a photo of yoga to spark the interest of the audience.

### Website Structure

Wellness with Jessica Rose consists of three html pages. THe layout of the website is engaging and offers you different sections to view when you are looking at the home page instead of having a navigation bar to scroll through you are drawn to different sections with different coloured backgrounds.

As well as the main page being engaging I inputted a gallery page which is meant to captivate the audience and feel a sense of happiness and inspiration that they themselves can hopefully one day achieve. I have used a range of photos to showcase that toga can be for anyone and for any age, also the aim of the gallery was to show that yoga and wellness can be avhieved in any enviorment and simly being in nature and outside is also ok.

The third page is where they can submit their name and email and then to hit the submit button which will take them to another page and thank them for submitting and that someone will be in touch with them soon. These pages were designed to be simple and to the point but still being conherent throughout.

### Imagery

The images are carefully chosen to set the tone of happiness and that yoga can be for any ages and also refelct the core values of the website that being mind, body and health. These three principles among many should be applied from our childhood into our older years. I have hopefully demonstarted this through the choices of my gallery.

Detailed alt attribute is included for each image to describe the scenery. The intention for this is to improve accessibility so that the images will deliver the same effect and be user friendly for those who are in aid of screen reading or any form of assistance.

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme for the website was for calming colours that are not loud and invasive but that offer you a tranquil journey through the website. I have ensured that each page follows the same colour scheme which you can find below.

The main colours that have been used throughout are a variations of earth tones. Once again trying to achieve an inner calmness but also with some variations of color to draw the audience in. I have started with a rgba(116, 90, 90, 0) which is a soft brown colour, furthermore I have used different gradients of pink in the home page and the sign up page. I hoped that using a brighter colour other than earth tones would then draw the eye to that specific part of the website. The colour text is a stone grey colour of #3a3a3a so that the text is easily readable in contrast with the light backgrounds.

### Typography

I have used the same font throughout the webiste as I didn't want the website to be overwellming since I have also have a gallery page. However I hope that I have achieved a more dynamic element to the text by adding emphasis tags onto certain words so that the audience know that this part is important.

## Features

### Existing Features

#### Navigation Bar

Featured on all HTML pages, the fully responsive navigation bar has the same design on every page. It is simple and to the point. It has a white background with the heading of Wellness with Jessica Rose with the dark grey text for the Home, Gallery and Sign up page.

#### Navigation bar for different pages

![colour scheme for website](https://github.com/JessicaroseD1/Wellness-by-Jessica-Rose/blob/main/docs/gallery.page.png)

When hovering over the Gallery and Sign up sections with the cursor, the cursor will change to the hand pointer to indicate that this is a button. You will also notice that when the hand icon is hoovering over that part of the section that it appears to be underlined emphasisng that this is the section that you are going to be taken to. That being said, when you are on the desired page the section will remain underlined so that you as the user will know what page you are on. I also made sure that for consistency to the header the font spacing inbetween the letters was consistent which was set at 4px. Over all having the navigation bar underlined and having the hand pointer are brilliant visual ques for the user to have.

#### Gallery Page

This page is the most engaging page within the website. It uses a range of photos, from people, to their age to their abilities. The gallery has been created with a coloumn count of 4. The aim was to create the design so that the pictures do not appear to have any space between them. However In the furture I would like to apply a baorder to the pictures to create the effect of space and have the page more streamline and potentially with a column count of 3.

#### Form page

The form page consists of three input fields where they have to fill in their details inorder to complete the process. I have achieved this outcome by inputting a required atribute. Once you have filled out all of the required information you are then able to press submit where you are taken to a separate page and are welcomed with a thank you message.

#### Footer

The footer section includes links to the social media sites as well as my own GitHub and Linkedin accounts. The links open in a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user. The footer is available on both HTML pages.

### Features Left to Implement

- At the moment when viewing the responsivness of the devices in Dev tolls if it is below 334 then the picture on the front page looses its resoloution and the text also overlaps or becomes hidden.
- website on a mobile device the word nourishment does not fit on the screen properly. Therefore I would need to look at the coding again and see if I can get the word to fit nicely on the page.
- The video on the home page is very wide, i would of prefered the video to be smaller and more stream line, however I found that then applying the media screen settings it was struggling with having the video different sizes on the different media screens. THerefore this was the only way that I could find to get it to look ok on all media outlets. Therefore I would need to do further research into seeing how I could get this to look more user friendly.
- I would also liked to have put in separate pages dedicated to Mind, Body and Nourishemnt so that the user could have some background knowledge on the core values of the website.

## Technologies Used

- [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html) was used to add styling to the website.
- [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) was used to create, edit and preview the codes.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) was used for version control and tracked changes in the codes.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) was used to store the codes and deploy the website.
- [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) were used when adjusting the objects in the website for different screen sizes.
- The website was fully validated using [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
- [Am I responsive?](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) was used to generate the mockup image showing the website on various screen sizes.
- The fonts used in the website are imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
- The website uses icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

## Testing

Regular testing was carried throught the process of building this website. Areas in which I had tested the website. As well as the coding validation programme I would check all the links that would have been added to see if they would take me to the correct page. For example if you was to hit the submit button would it open up in a separate page. If it did not I would then have to go back over the html pages and check for instance if they were active.

### Code Validation

The website was fully validated to ensure there were no syntax errors. The official [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) were used for the validation and no errors were found.
