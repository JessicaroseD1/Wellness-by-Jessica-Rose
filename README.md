## UX: User Experience

### User Stories

As a user,

- I would like to feel engaged with the website through the use of images and colours.
- I would like to be able to navigate easily through the website.
- I would like to be left feeling that I want to sign up to learn more.
- I would like to be inspired to invest in my wellbeing.
- I would like to be able to leave my details and be assured someone will be in contact.

### Initial Concept

The inital concept was to create a website that was visually engaging rather than a website that was full of information. Therefore the website has a colour theme throughout and is engaging from the Home page which offers a picture in the header and a photo of yoga to spark the interest of the audience.

### Website Structure

Wellness with Jessica Rose consists of three html pages. THe layout of the website is engaging and offers you different sections to view when you are looking at the home page instead of having a navigation bar to scroll through you are drawn to different sections with different coloured backgrounds.

As well as the main page being engaging I inputted a gallery page which is meant to captivate the audience and feel a sense of happiness and inspiration that they themselves can hopefully one day achieve. I have used a range of photos to showcase that toga can be for anyone and for any age, also the aim of the gallery was to show that yoga and wellness can be avhieved in any enviorment and simly being in nature and outside is also ok.

The third page is where they can submit their name and email and then to hit the submit button which will take them to another page and thank them for submitting and that someone will be in touch with them soon. These pages were designed to be simple and to the point but still being conherent throughout.

<!--input message about the responsive on different devices. It may not be responsive, you may need to mention that the table is not -->

### Imagery

The images are carefully chosen to set the tone of happiness and that yoga can be for any ages and also refelct the core values of the website that being mind, body and health. These three principles among many should be applied from our childhood into our older years. I have hopefully demonstarted this through the choices of my gallery.

Detailed alt attribute is included for each image to describe the scenery. The intention for this is to improve accessibility so that the images will deliver the same effect and be user friendly for those who are in aid of screen reading or any form of assistance.

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme for the website was for calming colours that are not loud and invasive but that offer you a tranquil journey through the website. I have ensured that each page follows the same colour scheme which you can find below.

The main colours that have been used throughout are a variations of earth tones. Once again trying to achieve an inner calmness but also with some variations of color to draw the audience in. I have started with a rgba(116, 90, 90, 0) which is a soft brown colour, furthermore I have used different gradients of pink in the home page and the sign up page. I hoped that using a brighter colour other than earth tones would then draw the eye to that specific part of the website. The colour text is a stone grey colour of #3a3a3a so that the text is easily readable in contrast with the light backgrounds.

### Typography

I have used the same font throughout the webiste as I didn't want the website to be overwellming since I have also have a gallery page. However I hope that I have achieved a more dynamic element to the text by adding emphasis tags onto certain words so that the audience know that this part is important.

## Features

### Existing Features

#### Navigation Bar

Featured on all HTML pages, the fully responsive navigation bar has the same design on every page. It is simple and to the point. It has a white background with the heading of Wellness with Jessica Rose with the dark grey text for the Home, Gallery and Sign up page.

#### Navigation bar for different pages

<!-- Insert picutre of navigation pane here -->

When hovering over the Gallery and Sign up sections with the cursor, the cursor will change to the hand pointer to indicate that this is a button. You will also notice that when the hand icon is hoovering over that part of the section that it appears to be underlined emphasisng that this is the section that you are going to be taken to. That being said, when you are on the desired page the section will remain underlined so that you as the user will know what page you are on. I also made sure that for consistency to the header the font spacing inbetween the letters was consistent which was set at 4px. Over all having the navigation bar underlined and having the hand pointer are brilliant visual ques for the user to have.

<!-- show an image of the home page underlined and then all the other pages too -->

#### Gallery Page

This page is the most engaging page within the website. It uses a range of photos, from people, to their age to their abilities. The gallery has been created with a coloumn count of 4. The aim was to create the design so that the pictures do not appear to have any space between them. However In the furture I would like to apply a baorder to the pictures to create the effect of space and have the page more streamline and potentially with a column count of 3.

<!-- insert gallery -->

#### Form page

The form page consists of three input fields where they have to fill in their details inorder to complete the process. I have achieved this outcome by inputting a required atribute. Once you have filled out all of the required information you are then able to press submit where you are taken to a separate page and are welcomed with a thank you message.

#### Footer

The footer section includes links to the social media sites as well as my own GitHub and Linkedin accounts. The links open in a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user. The footer is available on both HTML pages.

### Features Left to Implement

- At the moment when viewing the responsivness of the devices in Dev tolls if it is below 334 then the picture on the front page looses its resoloution and the text also overlaps or becomes hidden.
-
- website on a mobile device the word nourishment does not fit on the screen properly. Therefore I would need to look at the coding again and see if I can get the word to fit nicely on the page.
- The video on the home page is very wide, i would of prefered the video to be smaller and more stream line, however I found that then applying the media screen settings it was struggling with having the video different sizes on the different media screens. THerefore this was the only way that I could find to get it to look ok on all media outlets. Therefore I would need to do further research into seeing how I could get this to look more user friendly.
- I would also liked to have put in separate pages dedicated to Mind, Body and Nourishemnt so that the user could have some background knowledge on the core values of the website.

Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for Codeanywhere. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Codeanywhere and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **May 11th, 2023**

## Codeanywhere Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere with no-cache, you can use this alias for `python3 -m http.server`.

`http_server`

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

In Codeanywhere you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to _Account Settings_ in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the _API Key_ and click _Reveal_
3. Copy the key
4. In Codeanywhere, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

Happy coding!
