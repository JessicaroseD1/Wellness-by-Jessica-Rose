## UX: User Experience

### User Stories

As a user,

- I would like to feel engaged with the website through the use of images and colours.
- I would like to be able to navigate easily through the website.
- I would like to be left feeling that I want to sign up to learn more.
- I would like to be able to leave my details and be assured someone will be in contact.

### Initial Concept

The initial concept was to create a website that was visually engaging rather than a website that was full of information. Therefore the website has a colour theme throughout and is engaging from the Home page which offers a picture in the header and a photo of yoga to spark the interest of the audience.

### Website Structure

Wellness with Jessica Rose consists of three html pages. The layout of the website is engaging and offers you different sections to view when you are looking at the home page instead of having a navigation bar to scroll through you are drawn to different sections with different coloured backgrounds.

As well as the main page being engaging I inputted a gallery page which is meant to captivate the audience and feel a sense of happiness and inspiration that they can hopefully one day achieve. I have used a range of photos to showcase that toga can be for anyone and any age, the gallery aimed to show that yoga and wellness can be achieved in any environment and simply being in nature and outside is also ok.

The third page is where they can submit their name and email and then hit the submit button which will take them to another page and thank them for submitting and that someone will be in touch with them soon. These pages were designed to be simple and to the point but still being coherent throughout.

### Imagery

The images are carefully chosen to set the tone of happiness and that yoga can be for any age and also reflect the core values of the website that being mind, body and health. These three principles among many should be applied from our childhood into our older years. I have hopefully demonstrated this through the choices of my gallery.

Detailed alt attribute is included for each image to describe the scenery. The intention for this is to improve accessibility so that the images will deliver the same effect and be user-friendly for those who are in aid of screen reading or any form of assistance.

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme for the website was for calming colours that are not loud and invasive but that offer you a tranquil journey through the website. I have ensured that each page follows the same colour scheme which you can find below.

The main colours that have been used throughout are variations of earth tones. Once again trying to achieve an inner calmness but also with some variations of colour to draw the audience in. I have started with a rgba(116, 90, 90, 0) which is a soft brown colour, furthermore, I have used different gradients of pink in the home page and the signup page. I hoped that using a brighter colour other than earth tones would then draw the eye to that specific part of the website. The colour text is a stone grey colour of #3a3a3a so that the text is easily readable in contrast with the light backgrounds.

### Typography

I have used the same font throughout the website as I didn't want the website to be overwhelming since I also have a gallery page. However, I hope that I have achieved a more dynamic element to the text by adding emphasis tags to certain words so that the audience knows that this part is important.

## Features

### Existing Features

#### Navigation Bar

Featured on all HTML pages, the fully responsive navigation bar has the same design on every page. It is simple and to the point. It has a white background with the heading of Wellness with Jessica Rose with the dark grey text for the Home, Gallery and Sign up page.

#### Navigation bar for different pages

When hovering over the Gallery and Sign up sections with the cursor, the cursor will change to the hand pointer to indicate that this is a button. You will also notice that when the hand icon is hovering over that part of the section it appears to be underlined emphasising that this is the section that you are going to be taken to. That being said, when you are on the desired page the section will remain underlined so that you as the user will know what page you are on. I also made sure that for consistency to the header, the font spacing in between the letters was consistent which was set at 4px. Having the navigation bar underlined and having the hand pointer are brilliant visual cues for the user to have.

#### Gallery Page

This page is the most engaging page on the website. It uses a range of photos, from people to their age to their abilities. The gallery has been created with a column count of 4. The aim was to create the design so that the pictures do not appear to have any space between them. However, in the future, I would like to apply a border to the pictures to create the effect of space and have the page more streamlined and potentially with a column count of 3.

#### Form page

The form page consists of three input fields where they have to fill in their details in order to complete the process. I have achieved this outcome by inputting a required attribute. Once you have filled out all of the required information you are then able to press submit where you are taken to a separate page and are welcomed with a thank you message.

#### Footer

The footer section includes links to the social media sites as well as my own GitHub and Linkedin accounts. The links open in a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user. The footer is available on both HTML pages.

### Features Left to Implement

- Add in a back to home button on the sign up form.

## Technologies Used

- The website was created with [HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/).
- [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html) was used to add styling to the website.
- [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) was used to create, edit and preview the codes.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) was used for version control and tracked changes in the codes.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) was used to store the codes and deploy the website.
- [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) were used when adjusting the objects in the website for different screen sizes
- The website was fully validated using [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
- [Am I responsive?](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) was used to generate the mockup image showing the website on various screen sizes.
- The fonts used in the website are imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
- The website uses icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
- The website uses [cdnjs.com](https://cdnjs.com/) for Font Awesome icons so that the website loads quickly.
- The colour palette was generated with [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/).
- [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/) was used to fix grammatical errors across the website.

## Testing

Regular testing was carried throughout the process of building this website. Areas in which I had tested the website, as well as the coding validation programme, was that I would check all the links that would have been implemented to see if they would take me to the correct page. For example, if you were to hit the submit button would it open up on a separate page. If it did not I would then have to go back over the html pages and check for instance if they were active.

### Code Validation

The website was fully validated to ensure there were no syntax errors. The official [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) were used for the validation and no errors were found.

### Responsiveness

- Responsiveness design tests were executed using Chrome Dev Tools. I found that if the site had to go below 320px then the heading health would not be aligned and also the sections would overlap.
- I also would check the link from mobile phones to see how the website was responsive, from looking on an Iphone XS the website seemed to be in good working order.

Bugs to fix

- At the moment when viewing the responsiveness of the devices in Dev tolls if it is below 334 then the picture on the front page loses its resoloution and the text also overlaps or becomes hidden. This is something that I would need to further investigate.
- There is also a line under the submit button that I would once again need to investigate further as to why it is there

### User Stories
